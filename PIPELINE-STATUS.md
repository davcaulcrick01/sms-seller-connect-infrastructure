### Pipeline Stages

| Stage | Status | Last Run | Notes |
|-------|--------|----------|-------|
| Build Frontend | ✅ | - | Container builds successfully |
| Build Backend | ✅ | - | Container builds successfully |
| Test Frontend | ✅ | - | HTTP and React tests pass |
| Test Backend | ✅ | - | Database connectivity verified |
| Security Scan | ✅ | - | Vulnerability scanning enabled |
| Deploy | 🚧 | - | Infrastructure deployment pending |

### Environment Configuration

- **Development**: Local Docker containers
- **Staging**: Not configured
- **Production**: AWS ECS (planned)

### Key Infrastructure Files

- `modules/ec2/`: EC2 instance and related resources
- `modules/app/`: Application-specific configurations  
- `terraform/`: Main Terraform configuration
- `.github/workflows/`: CI/CD pipeline definitions

### Next Steps

1. Configure production database (PostgreSQL RDS)
2. Set up ECS cluster for container deployment
3. Configure Application Load Balancer
4. Set up CloudWatch monitoring and alerting
5. Implement backup strategies

## ✅ FIXED: Environment Variable Integration (June 28, 2025)

### Issue Resolved
The EC2 instance was failing to start Docker Compose services because environment variables were empty, showing errors like:
```
service "sms_backend" has neither an image nor a build context specified: invalid compose project
```

### Root Cause
The GitHub Actions workflow was using **only** `TF_VAR_*` environment variables and **not** using the `-var-file=terraform.tfvars` flag when running Terraform commands. This meant that:

1. ✅ **GitHub Secrets** were passed correctly via `TF_VAR_*` environment variables
2. ❌ **Non-sensitive configuration** from `terraform.tfvars` was **not** being used
3. ❌ **Local development** required manual `-var-file=terraform.tfvars` flag

### Solution Applied
Updated the GitHub Actions workflow to use **both** approaches:

1. **Environment Variables** (for secrets): `TF_VAR_*` from GitHub secrets/variables
2. **Config File** (for non-sensitive): `-var-file=terraform.tfvars` flag

### Changes Made
Updated all Terraform commands in `.github/workflows/terraform.yml`:

```bash
# Before (environment variables only)
terraform plan -input=false -detailed-exitcode -no-color -out=tfplan
terraform apply -auto-approve
terraform destroy -auto-approve

# After (environment variables + tfvars file)
terraform plan -var-file=terraform.tfvars -input=false -detailed-exitcode -no-color -out=tfplan
terraform apply -var-file=terraform.tfvars -auto-approve
terraform destroy -var-file=terraform.tfvars -auto-approve
```

### Benefits
- ✅ **Consistent behavior** between local development and CI/CD
- ✅ **Secure secrets** via GitHub environment variables
- ✅ **Non-sensitive config** via committed terraform.tfvars
- ✅ **No duplicate variable management** needed

### Test Status
- ✅ **Local Development**: Works with `terraform apply -var-file=terraform.tfvars`
- 🔄 **GitHub Actions**: Updated workflow ready for testing
- 🔄 **EC2 Bootstrap**: Should now receive all environment variables correctly

### Next Steps
1. Test the updated pipeline via GitHub Actions
2. Verify EC2 instance bootstraps successfully with all environment variables
3. Confirm Docker Compose starts all services correctly

### Boolean Variables Fix ✅
- **Issue**: Boolean variables passed as strings instead of booleans
- **Fix**: Removed quotes from boolean environment variable exports
- **Status**: Fixed

### JSON Variables Fix ✅
- **Issue**: `TF_VAR_tags` and `TF_VAR_common_tags` causing JSON parsing errors
- **Fix**: Added default empty values and unset commands
- **Status**: Fixed
