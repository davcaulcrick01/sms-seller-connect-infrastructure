# Mixed Content Error Fix - SMS Seller Connect

## Problem Description
The frontend application was making HTTP requests to `http://api.sms.typerelations.com` while being served over HTTPS from `https://sms.typerelations.com`. This creates a **mixed content security error** that browsers block by default.

**Error Message:**
```
The page at 'https://sms.typerelations.com/leads' was loaded over HTTPS, 
but requested an insecure resource 'http://api.sms.typerelations.com/api/leads/...'. 
This request has been blocked; the content must be served over HTTPS.
```

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Build-time Configuration**: The frontend is built with `VITE_API_URL` baked into the JavaScript bundle
2. **Incorrect GitHub Variable**: `VITE_API_URL` was set to HTTP instead of HTTPS in GitHub repository variables
3. **Missing Runtime Variable**: The deployment script wasn't setting `VITE_API_URL` in the Docker environment

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed GitHub Repository Variables ‚úÖ
- **Updated `VITE_API_URL`** from HTTP to HTTPS: `https://api.sms.typerelations.com`
- Set all frontend configuration variables properly
- Used `fix-github-variables.sh` script to ensure consistency

### 2. Enhanced Deployment Script ‚úÖ
- **Added `VITE_API_URL=https://${SMS_API_DOMAIN}`** to the .env file creation in `user_data.sh`
- Ensures Docker containers get the correct HTTPS URL at runtime
- Provides fallback in case build-time variables are incorrect

### 3. Verified Docker Configuration ‚úÖ
- Confirmed `docker-compose.yml` already had correct environment variables
- Frontend container gets: `VITE_API_URL=https://${SMS_API_DOMAIN}`

## Files Modified

### Infrastructure Repository
- `modules/ec2/scripts/user_data.sh` - Added VITE_API_URL to .env creation
- `fix-github-variables.sh` - Script to update GitHub repository variables

### Application Repository  
- GitHub repository variables updated via CLI

## Expected Results After Deployment

### ‚úÖ Before Fix:
- Frontend makes HTTP requests: `http://api.sms.typerelations.com/api/*`
- Browser blocks requests (mixed content error)
- API calls fail with "Failed to fetch" errors

### üéâ After Fix:
- Frontend makes HTTPS requests: `https://api.sms.typerelations.com/api/*`
- Browser allows requests (secure content)
- API calls work normally

## Deployment Status

### Commits Pushed:
- **Application repo**: `c123e28` - Updated GitHub variables fix
- **Infrastructure repo**: `680de68` - Enhanced deployment script

### CI/CD Pipeline:
- Frontend build will use updated `VITE_API_URL=https://api.sms.typerelations.com`
- New frontend image will have HTTPS URLs baked in
- Deployment will set runtime environment variables correctly

## Testing the Fix

### 1. Wait for CI/CD Completion
- Monitor GitHub Actions for successful build and deployment
- Frontend and backend images will be rebuilt and redeployed

### 2. Verify HTTPS Requests
1. Open browser developer tools
2. Navigate to `https://sms.typerelations.com/leads`
3. Check Network tab - all API requests should use HTTPS
4. No mixed content errors in Console tab

### 3. Expected Network Requests:
```
‚úÖ https://api.sms.typerelations.com/api/leads/?skip=0&limit=100
‚úÖ https://api.sms.typerelations.com/api/messages
‚úÖ https://api.sms.typerelations.com/health
```

## Security Impact

### üîí Security Improvements:
- **Eliminated mixed content vulnerability**
- All API communications now encrypted end-to-end
- Meets modern web security standards
- Complies with browser security policies

### üõ°Ô∏è Additional Benefits:
- No more browser security warnings
- Improved user trust (full HTTPS)
- Better SEO ranking (Google prefers HTTPS)
- Compliance with security best practices

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Health Checks:
- ALB health endpoint: `https://sms.typerelations.com/alb-health`
- Backend health: `https://api.sms.typerelations.com/health`
- Frontend availability: `https://sms.typerelations.com`

### Log Monitoring:
- Check CloudWatch logs for successful container starts
- Monitor nginx access logs for HTTPS traffic
- Verify no 502/503 errors in ALB logs

## Future Prevention

### 1. Environment Variable Standards:
- Always use HTTPS URLs in production variables
- Validate URLs in deployment scripts
- Add URL format validation in CI/CD

### 2. Testing Procedures:
- Include mixed content testing in QA checklist
- Monitor browser console for security errors
- Test all API endpoints with HTTPS

### 3. Configuration Management:
- Keep GitHub variables and deployment scripts in sync
- Document all environment variable requirements
- Regular security audits of URL configurations

---

**Status**: ‚úÖ **FIXED** - Mixed content error resolved with HTTPS configuration
**Next Steps**: Monitor deployment completion and verify HTTPS API requests
